NORLabelNode
============

Simple extension of Apple's SKLabelNode. Allowing multiple lines through the use of \n in the text-string. 
Usage: Behaves like an ordinary SKLabelNode with the one difference that adding newline characters to the text-
property actually adds line-breaks. This is achieved by creating SKLabelNodes as child-nodes, but keeping these as part of the internal (private) logic.

Language: Objective-C
Requirements: SpriteKit
